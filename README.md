### Overview

This is a SQL Server Analysis Services provider for [Transformalize](https://github.com/dalenewman/Transformalize). 
It is a work in process, but it pretty much works.

The idea behind this provider is to automatically create and deploy 
a cube based on your arrangement.  It requires that you use a SQL Server 
input.
